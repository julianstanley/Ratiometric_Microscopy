We work with fluorescent sensors. You shine light of a certain wavelength at them and, depending on that wavelength, the sensor shines light back at different intensities.

The relationship between the amount of light you shine on a sensor and the amount of light that it sends back is called an absorption spectrum. 

Our sensors have an extra feature in that they have two "states", like the "on" and "off" state of a light switch. In one state, the sensor is oxidized and, in the other, the sensor is reduced. These two different states will have different absorption spectra. For our sensor, they look like this:
