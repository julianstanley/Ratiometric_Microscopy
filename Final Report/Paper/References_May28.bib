abstract = {Novel dual emission, pH-sensitive variants of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) have been constructed and are suitable for ratiometric emission measurements in vivo. This new class of GFPs, termed deGPFs, results from substitution of wild-type residue 65 with threonine and residues 148 and/or 203 with cysteine. deGFPs display pK(a) values ranging from 6.8 to 8.0 and emission that switches from a green form (lambda(max) approximately 515 nm) to a blue form (lambda(max) approximately 460 nm) with acidifying pH. In this report we analyze in most detail the deGFP1 variant (S65T/H148G/T203C, pK(a) approximately 8.0) and the deGFP4 variant (S65T/C48S/H148C/T203C, pK(a) approximately 7.3). In the following paper [McAnaney, T. B., Park, E. S., Hanson, G. T., Remington, S. J., and Boxer, S. G. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 15489-15494], data obtained by ultrafast fluorescence upconversion spectroscopy can be described by a kinetic model that includes an excited-state proton-transfer pathway at high pH but not at low pH. Crystal structure analyses of deGFP1 at high-pH and low-pH conformations were performed to elucidate the basis for the dual emission characteristics. At low pH the structure does not contain a hydrogen bond network that would support rapid transfer of a proton from the excited state of the neutral chromophore to a suitable acceptor; hence blue emission is observed. At high pH, backbone rearrangements induced by changes in the associated hydrogen bond network permit excited-state proton transfer from the excited state of the neutral chromophore to the bulk solvent via Ser147 and bound water molecules, resulting in green emission from the anionic chromophore. Comparative analysis suggests that the basis for dual emission is elimination of the wild-type proton-transfer network by the S65T substitution, a general reduction in hydrogen-bonding opportunities, and a concomitant increase in the hydrophobic nature of the chromophore environment resulting from the cysteine substitutions. We evaluated the suitability of the deGFP4 variant for intracellular pH measurements in mammalian cells by transient expression in PS120 fibroblasts. The responses of deGFP4 and a commercially available pH-sensitive dye, SNARF-1, to changes in pH were compared in the same cells. Results show that the dynamic range of the emission ratio change is comparable between the two pH sensors over the range examined. Two-photon excitation was found to elicit a better deGFP4 fluorescent signal above cellular autofluorescence when compared to conventional confocal microscopy. Given their favorable optical characteristics, suitable pK(a)'s for the physiological pH range, and suitability for ratiometric measurements, dual emission GFPs should make excellent probes for studying pH in vivo.},

abstract = {Mitochondria extrude protons across their inner membrane to generate the mitochondrial membrane potential ($\Delta$$\Psi$(m)) and pH gradient ($\Delta$pH(m)) that both power ATP synthesis. Mitochondrial uptake and efflux of many ions and metabolites are driven exclusively by $\Delta$pH(m), whose in situ regulation is poorly characterized. Here, we report the first dynamic measurements of $\Delta$pH(m) in living cells, using a mitochondrially targeted, pH-sensitive YFP (SypHer) combined with a cytosolic pH indicator (5-(and 6)-carboxy-SNARF-1). The resting matrix pH (∼7.6) and $\Delta$pH(m) (∼0.45) of HeLa cells at 37 °C were lower than previously reported. Unexpectedly, mitochondrial pH and $\Delta$pH(m) decreased during cytosolic Ca(2+) elevations. The drop in matrix pH was due to cytosolic acid generated by plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPases and transmitted to mitochondria by P(i)/H(+) symport and K(+)/H(+) exchange, whereas the decrease in $\Delta$pH(m) reflected the low H(+)-buffering power of mitochondria (∼5 mm, pH 7.8) compared with the cytosol (∼20 mm, pH 7.4). Upon agonist washout and restoration of cytosolic Ca(2+) and pH, mitochondria alkalinized and $\Delta$pH(m) increased. In permeabilized cells, a decrease in bath pH from 7.4 to 7.2 rapidly decreased mitochondrial pH, whereas the addition of 10 $\mu$m Ca(2+) caused a delayed and smaller alkalinization. These findings indicate that the mitochondrial matrix pH and $\Delta$pH(m) are regulated by opposing Ca(2+)-dependent processes of stimulated mitochondrial respiration and cytosolic acidification.},

abstract = {Changes in pH are now widely accepted as a signalling mechanism in cells. In plants, proton pumps in the plasma membrane and tonoplast play a key role in regulation of intracellular pH homeostasis and maintenance of transmembrane proton gradients. Proton transport in response to external stimuli can be expected to be finely regulated spatially and temporally. With the ambition to follow such changes live, a new genetically encoded sensor, pHusion, has been developed. pHusion is especially designed for apoplastic pH measurements. It was constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis and targeted for expression in either the cytosol or the apoplast including intracellular compartments. pHusion consists of the tandem concatenation of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP1), and works as a ratiometric pH sensor. Live microscopy at high spatial and temporal resolution is highly dependent on appropriate immobilization of the specimen for microscopy. Medical adhesive often used in such experiments destroys cell viability in roots. Here a novel system for immobilizing Arabidopsis seedling roots for perfusion experiments is presented which does not impair cell viability. With appropriate immobilization, it was possible to follow changes of the apoplastic and cytosolic pH in mesophyll and root tissue. Rapid pH homeostasis upon external pH changes was reflected by negligible cytosolic pH fluctuations, while the apoplastic pH changed drastically. The great potential for analysing pH regulation in a whole-tissue, physiological context is demonstrated by the immediate alkalinization of the subepidermal apoplast upon external indole-3-acetic acid administration. This change is highly significant in the elongation zone compared with the root hair zone and control roots.},

abstract = {The usefulness of genetically encoded probes for optical monitoring of neuronal activity and brain circuits would be greatly advanced by the generation of multiple indicators with non-overlapping color spectra. Most existing indicators are derived from or spectrally convergent on GFP. We generated a bright, red, pH-sensitive fluorescent protein, pHTomato, that can be used in parallel with green probes to monitor neuronal activity. SypHTomato, made by fusing pHTomato to the vesicular membrane protein synaptophysin, reported activity-dependent exocytosis as efficiently as green reporters. When expressed with the GFP-based indicator GCaMP3 in the same neuron, sypHTomato enabled concomitant imaging of transmitter release and presynaptic Ca(2+) transients at single nerve terminals. Expressing sypHTomato and GCaMP3 in separate cells enabled the simultaneous determination of presynaptic vesicular turnover and postsynaptic sub- and supra-threshold responses from a connected pair of neurons. With these new tools, we observed a close size matching between pre- and postsynaptic compartments, as well as interesting target cell-dependent regulation of presynaptic vesicle pools. Lastly, by coupling expression of pHTomato- and GFP-based probes with distinct variants of channelrhodopsin, we provided proof-of-principle for an all-optical approach to multiplex control and tracking of distinct circuit pathways.},

abstract = {This study reports the influence of halogens on fluorescence properties of the Aequorea victoria Green Fluorescent Protein variant S65T/T203Y (E 2GFP). Halide binding forms a specific nonfluorescent complex generating a substantial drop of the fluorescence via static quenching. Spectroscopic analysis under different solution conditions reveals high halogen affinity, which is strongly dependent on the pH. This evidences the presence in E2GFP of interacting binding sites for halide ions and for protons. Thermodynamic link and cooperative interaction are assessed demonstrating that binding of one halide ion is associated with the binding of one proton in a cooperative fashion with the formation, in the pH range 4.5-10, of a single fully protonated E2GFP{\textperiodcentered}halogen complex. To resolve the structural determinants of E2GFP sensitivity to halogens, high-resolution crystallographic structures were obtained for the halide-free and I-, Br-, and Cl- bound E2GFP. Remarkably the first high-resolution (1.4 {\AA}) crystallographic structure of a chloride-bound GFP is reported. The chloride ion occupies a specific and unique binding pocket in direct contact (3.4 {\AA}) with the chromophore imidazolidinone aromatic ring. Unanticipated flexibility, strongly modulated by halide ion interactions, is observed in the region surrounding the chromophore. Furthermore molecular dynamics simulations identified E222 residue (along with the chromophore Y66 residue) being in the protonated state when E 2GFP{\textperiodcentered}halogen complex is formed. The impact of these results on high-sensitivity biosensor design will be discussed. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Biophysical Society.},

Only minor effects of extracellular chloride on pHCECSensor01 were observed around the physiological concentrations of this anion. In MDCK cells, the sensor was able to detect changes in pH secondary to H(+) efflux into the basolateral spaces elicited by an ammonium prepulse or lactate load. This genetically encoded sensor has the potential to serve as a noninvasive tool for monitoring changes in extracellular pH microdomains in epithelial and other tissues in vivo.},

abstract = {A major goal of research in ecology and evolution is to explain why species richness varies across habitats, regions, and clades. Recent reviews have argued that species richness patterns among regions and clades may be explained by “ecological limits” on diversity over time, which are said to offer an alternative explanation to those invoking speciation and extinction (diversification) and time. Further, it has been proposed that this hypothesis is best supported by failure to find a positive relationship between time (e.g., clade age) and species richness. Here, I critically review the evidence for these claims, and propose how we might better study the ecological and evolutionary origins of species richness patterns. In fact, ecological limits can only influence species richness in clades by influencing speciation and extinction, and so this new “alternative paradigm” is simply one facet of the traditional idea that ecology influences diversification. The only direct evidence for strict ecological limits on richness (i.e., constant diversity over time) is from the fossil record, but many studies cited as supporting this pattern do not, and there is evidence for increasing richness over time. Negative evidence for a relationship between clade age and richness among extant clades is not positive evidence for constant diversity over time, and many recent analyses finding no age-diversity relationship were biased to reach this conclusion. More comprehensive analyses strongly support a positive age-richness relationship. There is abundant evidence that both time and ecological influences on diversification rates are important drivers of both large-scale and small-scale species richness patterns. The major challenge for future studies is to understand the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms underpinning the relationships between time, dispersal, diversification, and species richness patterns},

@article{Iwai2008,
abstract = {Many proteins have been shown to undergo conformational changes in response to externally applied force in vitro, but whether the force-induced protein conformational changes occur in vivo remains unclear. To reveal the force-induced conformational changes, or strains, within proteins in living cells, we have developed a genetically encoded fluorescent "strain sensor," by combining the proximity imaging (PRIM) technique, which uses spectral changes of 2 GFP molecules that are in direct contact, and myosin-actin as a model system. The developed PRIM-based strain sensor module (PriSSM) consists of the tandem fusion of a normal and circularly permuted GFP. To apply strain to PriSSM, it was inserted between 2 motor domains of Dictyostelium myosin II. In the absence of strain, the 2 GFP moieties in PriSSM are in contact, whereas when the motor domains are bound to F-actin, PriSSM has a strained conformation, leading to the loss of contact and a concomitant spectral change. Using the sensor system, we found that the position of the lever arm in the rigor state was affected by mutations within the motor domain. Moreover, the sensor was used to visualize the interaction between myosin II and F-actin in Dictyostelium cells. In normal cells, myosin was largely detached from F-actin, whereas ATP depletion or hyperosmotic stress increased the fraction of myosin bound to F-actin. The PRIM-based strain sensor may provide a general approach for studying force-induced protein conformational changes in cells.},

abstract = {Cells adjust their behaviour in response to redox events by regulating protein activity through the reversible formation of disulfide bridges between cysteine thiols. However, the spatial and temporal control of these modifications remains poorly understood in multicellular organisms. Here we measured the protein thiol-disulfide balance in live Caenorhabditis elegans using a genetically encoded redox sensor and found that it is specific to tissues and is patterned spatially within a tissue. Insulin signalling regulates the sensor's oxidation at both of these levels. Unexpectedly, we found that isogenic individuals exhibit large differences in the sensor's thiol-disulfide balance. This variation contrasts with the general view that glutathione acts as the main cellular redox buffer. Indeed, our work suggests that glutathione converts small changes in its oxidation level into large changes in its redox potential. We therefore propose that glutathione facilitates the sensitive control of the thiol-disulfide balance of target proteins in response to cellular redox events.},

abstract = {High-throughput single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become an established and powerful method to investigate transcriptomic cell-to-cell variation, and has revealed new cell types, and new insights into developmental process and stochasticity in gene expression. There are now several published scRNA-seq protocols, which all sequence transcriptomes from a minute amount of starting material. Therefore, a key question is how these methods compare in terms of sensitivity of detection of mRNA molecules, and accuracy of quantification of gene expression. Here, we assessed the sensitivity and accuracy of many published data sets based on standardized spike-ins with a uniform raw data processing pipeline. We developed a flexible and fast UMI counting tool (https://github.com/vals/umis) which is compatible with all UMI based protocols. This allowed us to relate these parameters to sequencing depth, and discuss the trade offs between the different methods. To confirm our results, we performed experiments on cells from the same population using three different protocols. We also investigated the effect of RNA degradation on spike-in molecules, and the average efficiency of scRNA-seq on spike-in molecules versus endogenous RNAs.},

abstract = {Dual-color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) is a promising technique for quantifying protein-protein interactions. In this technique, two different fluorescent labels are excited and detected simultaneously within a common measurement volume. Difficulties in aligning two laser lines and emission crossover between the two fluorophores, however, make this technique complex. To overcome these limitations, we developed a fluorescent protein with a large Stokes shift. This protein, named Keima, absorbs and emits light maximally at 440 nm and 620 nm, respectively. Combining a monomeric version of Keima with cyan fluorescent protein allowed dual-color FCCS with a single 458-nm laser line and complete separation of the fluorescent protein emissions. This FCCS approach enabled sensitive detection of proteolysis by caspase-3 and the association of calmodulin with calmodulin-dependent enzymes. In addition, Keima and a spectral variant that emits maximally at 570 nm might facilitate simultaneous multicolor imaging with single-wavelength excitation.},

abstract = {Molecular activities are highly dynamic and can occur locally in subcellular domains or compartments. Neighboring cells in the same tissue can exist in different states. Therefore, quantitative information on the cellular and subcellular dynamics of ions, signaling molecules, and metabolites is critical for functional understanding of organisms. Mass spectrometry is generally used for monitoring ions and metabolites; however, its temporal and spatial resolution are limited. Fluorescent proteins have revolutionized many areas of biology-e.g., fluorescent proteins can report on gene expression or protein localization in real time-yet promoter-based reporters are often slow to report physiologically relevant changes such as calcium oscillations. Therefore, novel tools are required that can be deployed in specific cells and targeted to subcellular compartments in order to quantify target molecule dynamics directly. We require tools that can measure enzyme activities, protein dynamics, and biophysical processes (e.g., membrane potential or molecular tension) with subcellular resolution. Today, we have an extensive suite of tools at our disposal to address these challenges, including translocation sensors, fluorescence-intensity sensors, and F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer sensors. This review summarizes sensor design principles, provides a database of sensors for more than 70 different analytes/processes, and gives examples of applications in quantitative live cell imaging.},

abstract = {The quantitative comparison of data acquired under different conditions is an important aspect of experimental science. The most widely used statistic for quantitative comparisons is the p-value. However, p-values suffer from several shortcomings. The most prominent shortcoming that is relevant for quantitative comparisons is that p-values fail to convey the magnitude of differences. The differences between conditions are best quantified by the determination of effect size. To democratize the calculation of effect size, we have developed a web-based tool. The tool uses bootstrapping to resample mean or median values for each of the conditions and these values are used to calculate the effect size and their compatibility interval. The web tool generates a graphical output, showing the bootstrap distribution of the difference next to the actual data for optimal interpretation. A tabular output with statistics and effect sizes is also generated and the table can be supplemented with p-values that are calculated with a randomization test.
