# Ratiometric_Microscopy
A project analyzing the parameters that go into interpreting data from ratiometric florescent sensors

A work in progress. Check back soon!



### Description

This is the main repository for the analysis of ratiometric sensors. As this project expands, it may turn into multiple repositories.



**Part 1: Analysis of roGFP-R12 in Apfeld lab**

* Derivations
* Visualizations

**Part 2: Generalizing analysis to all ratiometric sensors**



**Part 3: Creating tools to visualize the parameters of sensors**
